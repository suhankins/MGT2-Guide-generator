# MGT2 Guide Generator
Scripts used for updating [my Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2374616129) for Mad Games Tycoon 2.

## How to use
1. Copy **Genres.txt** from "Mad Games Tycoon 2\Mad Games Tycoon 2_Data\Extern\Text\DATA", **themes_en.txt** and **themes_ge.txt** from "Mad Games Tycoon 2\Mad Games Tycoon 2_Data\Extern\Text\EN" and "Mad Games Tycoon 2\Mad Games Tycoon 2_Data\Extern\Text\GE" repsectively.
2. Run main.py
3. Copy printed text and paste it into your guide
4. Press Enter, go back to step 3 and keep doing this until script stops
5. Congratulations, you have your very own Steam guide!

## Why is themes_ge.txt needed?
Only German themes file has genre information included (It's German, because it's developer's native language)
